Definetly a sucker for the corny asthetic of the main character and goofy one-liners. Weakest part of the movie was the villian but Rami Malek did alright with what he was given. 2nd best Craig bond film behind Casino Royale', rating: 'C+', status: 'Completed', cast: 'Daniel Craig, Rami Malek, Lea Seydoux, Lashana Lynch, Cristop Waltz, Ralph Fiennes', plot: 'James Bond is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica after leaving active service.

This record is scattered with different genres stretching from jazz, hip-hop, house and even disco influences arise from it. You'd think it would sound like a mess right? Absolutely not. Kaytranada demonstrates how incredibly versatile he is in his production combining the array of genres with different vocalists for different purposes.", rating: 'B+', status: 'Completed', cast: '', plot: '')

Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic", rating: 'A-', status: 'Completed', cast: "Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto", plot: "In deep space, the crew of the commercial starship Nostromo is awakened from their cryo-sleep capsules halfway through their journey home to investigate a distress call from an alien vessel.

As much as this is a story-driven RPG, Breath of the Wild is about its world, a world so vast that you could spend hours upon hours traversing its lands (trust me, I did) before actually making tangible progress in the story...It’s the Zelda game we’ve all been waiting for.")
